# Whats the hold up?

    An analysis of flights from January 2018 to July 2022

[The Full Dataset]

the minutes count for arrival and departure delays is vague.

(Counts vs Sums)

whats more important? consistency? or Quantity?

    this data makes Soutwest look like they are constant offenders (they are) but they also make up more than  18% of total flights the next three top airlines only make up 10% each
